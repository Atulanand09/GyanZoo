🚀 Project Overview

GYANZoo is a sleek, modern web application designed to showcase curated content across multiple domains — including Tech, Design, Art, Review and Science. The aim is to provide users with an elegant, easy-to-navigate browsing experience where they can discover high-quality topics and dive deeper into each category.

Key features:

Multi-category landing page showing “Tech”, “Design”, “Art”, “Review”, “Science” content modules.

Clean UI/UX with visual thumbnails for each category.

Responsive and lightweight front-end, suitable for quick browsing and mobile use.

Built and deployed using static hosting (Netlify) to ensure fast load times and minimal backend complexity.

🎯 Motivation

In today’s digital world, content discovery can be overwhelming. With so many topics, platforms and formats, users often struggle to find what truly interests them. GYANZoo addresses this by:

Categorising content into clear, focused domains.

Providing a simple, distraction-free interface that emphasises the content itself (via thumbnails and headings).

Enabling quick browsing with minimal friction.

🛠️ Technology Stack

Front-end: HTML5, CSS3, modern JavaScript (ES6+).

Deployment: Static site hosted via Netlify (zero server backend).

Optimised for performance, fast load and mobile responsiveness.

✅ What’s Done

Created visually appealing landing page with 5 major content categories (Tech, Design, Art, Review, Science).

Each category section includes a thumbnail image, title, subtitle, and by-line (e.g., “By Tech Explained”).

Navigation bar with links: Home | Search | Inbox | Profile.

Fully responsive layout tested on desktop and mobile.

Deployed and live at the above link.

🔭 Future Improvements

Add separate category pages with full article lists and filtering/sorting.

Integrate a search functionality (currently placeholder).

Backend or CMS integration to allow dynamic content management instead of static articles.

User authentication + personalised experience (favourites, bookmarking).

Analytics, performance enhancements and SEO optimisation.

Accessibility improvements (ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, contrast audit).
